    "# Passenger and Plane Itinerary Optimization (PPIO) Problem\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description: \n",
    "\n",
    "For a given list of passengers with predefined origin airports and final destination airports, a fixed number of planes in operation, and a fixed network topology $G(A,R)$, we want to extract the optimal schedule or itinerary for each plane $p$ and each passenger $h$ throughout the day. \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is related to the class of Traveling Salesman Problems, where the goal is to find the shortest distance path through cities such that the salesman starts and stops at the same city. The key differences in this optimization problem is that we are interested in minimizing the total travel time over each passenger $h$, and we have multiple agents traversing the network at scheduled times.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will solve this optimization problem using a multi-integer linear programming approach. There are many applications of this optimization problem including logistics planning, energy management, crew scheduling, and telecommunications network design.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PPIO Model Formulation:\n",

    "### Sets and Indices\n",

    "2. Passengers, denoted by $H$.\n",

    "4. Discretized times, denoted by $T$. Total number of time periods will be denoted by $|T|$.\n",
    "5. Flights, denoted by $F$. These are pairs $(e,t)$ of edges and starting times. A flight, $f$, is a possible plane going along $e$, with starting time $t$ (at the origin airport of $e$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Variables\n",
    "1. For every $h \\in H$, $f \\in F$, let $X_{h,f}=1$  if and only if human $h$ takes the flight $f$.\n",
    "2. For every $p \\in P$, $f \\in F$,  let $Y_{p,f}=1$ if and only if aircraft $p$ flies flight $f$.\n",
    "3. For every $t \\in T$, $a \\in A$, $h \\in H$, let $Z_{t,h,a} = 1$ if and only if human $h$ is at airport $a$ at time $t$.\n",
    "4. For every $t \\in T$, $a \\in A$, $p \\in P$, let $W_{t,p,a} = 1$ if and only if aircraft $p$ is at airport $a$ (waiting) at time $t$.$\n",
