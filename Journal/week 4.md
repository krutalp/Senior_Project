# Week 4 Updates

1. LP formulation - Approach 1 (Analytical Solutions)
   
  Points of Difficulty
    1. Any feasible method to store and continuous update the total travel time
    2. Lacking enough data on passenger iternaries (source to destination travel paths) in order to compute the total travel time for passengers.


2. Network Passenger Flow (Simulation-based approach)
