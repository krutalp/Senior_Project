1. LP formulation - Approach 1 (Analytical Solutions)

Consider the following constants/variables:
- $B_{i,j,p}^{t}$ ~ {1 - if plane p flies route (i,j) at time t, 0 otherwise}
- $\tau_{i,j}$ ~ flight duration between airport i and airport j
- $D_{i,j}^{t}$ ~ Number of passengers with origin i and final destination j
- $K_{i}^{t}$ ~ airport capcacity / number of additional aircraft at time t
- $C_{i,j}^{t}$ ~ operational cost for route (i,j)
- $L_{p}$ ~ capacity of plane p
- $\delta_{i}$ ~ transfer time
